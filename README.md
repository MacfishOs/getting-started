# Building Cutefish from Source

How to build the Cutefish desktop from source and install it on an existing
Linux distribution. There is no installer image yet, so building from source
is the only way to try it.

This guide is written for people trying Cutefish early and for AI coding
agents doing the build for them. Commands are complete and run in order;
an agent can follow them step by step.

Cutefish is developed and tested on Debian 13 (trixie). Other distributions
work if they ship the library versions listed under
[Requirements](#requirements); the package names below are Debian's, and
[Other distributions](#other-distributions) explains how to find the
equivalents.

## Components

| Repository | Need | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| [cutefish-toolkit](https://github.com/cutefishos/cutefish-toolkit) | Required | UI toolkit every component is built on |
| [cutefish-framework](https://github.com/cutefishos/cutefish-framework) | Required | Clients of system services, file operations |
| [cutefish-core](https://github.com/cutefishos/cutefish-core) | Required | Session, system services, polkit agent, screen recorder |
| [cutefish-compositor](https://github.com/cutefishos/cutefish-compositor) | Required | Wayland compositor, window manager, status bar, dock, launcher, lock screen |
| [filemanager](https://github.com/cutefishos/filemanager) | Required | File manager; also draws the desktop and its icons |
| [icons](https://github.com/cutefishos/icons) | Required | Default icon theme |
| [wallpapers](https://github.com/cutefishos/wallpapers) | Required | Default wallpaper |
| [settings](https://github.com/cutefishos/settings) | Recommended | System Settings |
| [terminal](https://github.com/cutefishos/terminal) | Recommended | Terminal |
| [xdg-desktop-portal-cutefish](https://github.com/cutefishos/xdg-desktop-portal-cutefish) | Recommended | File chooser, screen sharing and settings for sandboxed and browser apps |
| [cutefish-dm](https://github.com/cutefishos/cutefish-dm) | Optional | Login screen; skip it if you keep SDDM, GDM or LightDM |
| [qt-plugins](https://github.com/cutefishos/qt-plugins) | Optional | Makes Qt 6 applications follow the Cutefish style and scrolling |
| [text-editor](https://github.com/cutefishos/text-editor) | Optional | Text editor |
| [video-player](https://github.com/cutefishos/video-player) | Optional | Video player |
| [calendar](https://github.com/cutefishos/calendar) | Optional | Calendar |
| [system-monitor](https://github.com/cutefishos/system-monitor) | Optional | System monitor |

Without the recommended components the desktop runs, but the Settings and
Terminal icons pinned to the dock open nothing.

## Requirements

- A GPU with an EGL and OpenGL ES 2 driver and kernel modesetting. Virtual
  machines need a 3D-capable display device, such as virtio-gpu with
  virgl.
- systemd and systemd-logind.
- Wayland 1.23 or newer, wayland-protocols 1.39 or newer, PipeWire 0.3.65 or
  newer, CMake 3.22 or newer.
- A C++20 compiler (GCC or Clang) and Clang, which builds Skia.
- Network access while building cutefish-toolkit, which downloads Skia.
- Optional components: Qt 6 for qt-plugins, libmpv 0.35 or newer for
  video-player.

Everything installs into `/usr`. Use `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr` as shown;
other prefixes do not work, because the session and the compositor start
and trust their programs by their `/usr/bin` paths.

## 1. Install the build dependencies

On Debian 13, for the required and recommended components:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git cmake ninja-build pkg-config clang python3 \
    libwayland-dev libwayland-bin wayland-protocols \
    libegl-dev libgles-dev libgbm-dev libdrm-dev \
    libxkbcommon-dev libinput-dev libseat-dev libudev-dev libsystemd-dev libpam0g-dev \
    libfontconfig-dev libfreetype-dev libharfbuzz-dev libicu-dev libexpat1-dev \
    libpng-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libwebp-dev libtiff-dev libheif-dev libjxl-dev \
    libpipewire-0.3-dev libspa-0.2-dev \
    libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libva-dev \
    libxcb1-dev libxcb-composite0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-sync-dev \
    libarchive-dev libfuse3-dev libmtp-dev libsmbclient-dev libssh-dev libzip-dev \
    libcrypt-dev libxcursor-dev libpcre2-dev gtk-update-icon-cache
```

Add these for the optional components you want:

| Component | Packages |
|---|---|
| cutefish-dm | none beyond the list above |
| qt-plugins | `qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev qt6-declarative-dev qt6-declarative-private-dev librsvg2-dev` |
| text-editor | none beyond the list above |
| video-player | `libmpv-dev` |
| calendar | `libcurl4-openssl-dev libical-dev` |
| system-monitor | none beyond the list above |

To build the tests as well, add `libgtest-dev` and configure with
`-DBUILD_TESTING=ON` instead of `OFF` in step 3.

## 2. Get the sources

Clone the repositories side by side. Leave out the optional ones you do not
want.

```shell
mkdir -p ~/cutefish && cd ~/cutefish
for repo in cutefish-toolkit cutefish-framework cutefish-core cutefish-compositor \
    filemanager icons wallpapers settings terminal xdg-desktop-portal-cutefish \
    cutefish-dm qt-plugins text-editor video-player calendar system-monitor; do
    git clone https://github.com/cutefishos/$repo.git
done
```

cutefish-toolkit builds a pinned revision of Skia, which has to be fetched
first:

```shell
cutefish-toolkit/scripts/fetch-skia.sh
```

## 3. Build and install

Build in this order. Each project is installed before the next is
configured, because later projects find earlier ones through their
installed CMake packages.

```shell
cd ~/cutefish
for repo in cutefish-toolkit cutefish-framework qt-plugins icons cutefish-core \
    cutefish-dm filemanager terminal xdg-desktop-portal-cutefish settings \
    system-monitor text-editor video-player calendar cutefish-compositor wallpapers; do
    [ -d "$repo" ] || continue
    cmake -S "$repo" -B "build/$repo" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF || break
    cmake --build "build/$repo" --parallel "$(nproc)" || break
    sudo cmake --install "build/$repo" || break
done
```

The loop stops at the first failure; fix it, usually a missing package, and
run it again. cutefish-toolkit takes the longest, since it builds Skia.

To build the compositor without X11 application support, which also drops
the `libxcb-*` build dependencies, configure it with
`-DCUTEFISH_ENABLE_XWAYLAND=OFF`.

## 4. Install the runtime dependencies

```shell
sudo apt install accountsservice polkitd gsettings-desktop-schemas xdg-user-dirs \
    network-manager bluez upower power-profiles-daemon udisks2 fuse3 \
    pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber gnome-keyring libpam-gnome-keyring \
    xdg-desktop-portal xwayland adwaita-icon-theme
```

`xwayland` runs X11 applications; `adwaita-icon-theme` provides the fallback
cursors. `systemd-coredump` is recommended, so the crash dialog can show
what crashed.

## 5. Log in

### With your existing display manager

Log out, choose **Cutefish (Wayland)** in the session menu of SDDM, GDM or
LightDM, and log in. Nothing else is needed; cutefish-dm can stay
uninstalled.

### With cutefish-dm (optional)

cutefish-dm runs its login screen as a system user, which a source install
has to create once:

```shell
sudo useradd --system --user-group --home-dir /var/lib/cutefish-greeter \
    --create-home cutefish-greeter
```

Then replace the current display manager. This takes effect at the next
boot; replace `sddm` with `gdm3` or `lightdm` as appropriate.

```shell
sudo systemctl disable sddm
sudo systemctl enable cutefish-dm
```

To go back, run the same commands with the names swapped.

## Updating

Pull every repository, fetch Skia again in case its pinned revision changed,
and run the loop in step 3 again:

```shell
cd ~/cutefish
for repo in */; do [ -d "$repo/.git" ] && git -C "$repo" pull --ff-only; done
cutefish-toolkit/scripts/fetch-skia.sh
```

Log out and back in afterwards. The file manager also draws the desktop, so
a new filemanager build takes effect at the next login.

## Uninstalling

Each build directory records what it installed:

```shell
cd ~/cutefish
for manifest in build/*/install_manifest.txt; do
    xargs -d '\n' sudo rm -f -- < "$manifest"
done
```

Switch back to your previous display manager first if you enabled
cutefish-dm.

## Other distributions

Build dependencies are looked up through pkg-config, apart from a few
libraries found by name, noted in the table. Install the package that
provides each module below; on Fedora, `sudo dnf install
'pkgconfig(<module>)'` does this directly, and on Arch Linux,
`pacman -F <module>.pc` names the package.

| Components | pkg-config modules |
|---|---|
| All | `wayland-client` (>= 1.23), `wayland-server`, `wayland-egl`, `wayland-scanner`, `wayland-protocols` (>= 1.39), `egl`, `glesv2`, `xkbcommon`, `libsystemd`, `fontconfig`, `freetype2`, `harfbuzz`, `icu-uc`, `icu-i18n`, `expat`, `libpng`, `libjpeg`, `zlib`, `libwebp`, `libtiff-4`, `libheif`, `libjxl`, `libjxl_threads` |
| cutefish-framework | `libpipewire-0.3` (>= 0.3.65), `libspa-0.2` |
| cutefish-core | `gbm`, `libdrm`, `libavcodec`, `libavformat`, `libavutil`, `libswscale`, `libva` |
| cutefish-compositor | `gbm`, `libdrm`, `libinput`, `libseat`, `libudev`, `xcb`, `xcb-composite`, `xcb-xfixes`, `xcb-shape`, `xcb-sync`; the PAM library |
| cutefish-dm | the PAM library |
| filemanager | `libarchive`, `fuse3`, `libmtp`, `smbclient`, `libssh`, `libudev`, and the libzip headers and library |
| settings | `xcursor`; the libcrypt library |
| terminal | `libpcre2-16` |
| text-editor | `libpcre2-8` |
| video-player | `mpv` (>= 2.0, from libmpv 0.35) |
| calendar | `libcurl`, `libical` |
| qt-plugins | Qt 6 Core, Gui, Widgets, DBus, Quick and their private headers; `librsvg-2.0` |

Besides libraries, the build needs `git`, `cmake`, `ninja`, `pkg-config`,
`clang`, `python3` and `gtk-update-icon-cache` (for icons). The runtime
services in step 4 go by the same names on most distributions:
NetworkManager, BlueZ, UPower, power-profiles-daemon, UDisks2, PipeWire with
WirePlumber, AccountsService, polkit, GNOME Keyring, xdg-desktop-portal and
Xwayland.

## Notes for AI agents

- Run the steps in order and stop at the first error; report the failing
  command and its output rather than working around it.
- Keep the install prefix `/usr` and the build order from step 3.
- Only install the optional components the user asked for. Treat cutefish-dm
  as optional unless the user wants it: it replaces the display manager and
  changes what appears at the next boot, so confirm before enabling it.
- Do not disable or remove the user's current desktop or display manager
  without asking.
- A successful install is checked by
  `test -f /usr/share/wayland-sessions/cutefish-wayland.desktop` and
  `command -v cutefish-compositor cutefish-wayland-session`. The desktop
  itself can only be tried by logging in to the session on real hardware or
  in a virtual machine with 3D acceleration.
